- **Flexible Configurations**: Adjust parameters to suit your specific needs for various image generation tasks.

## Installation

To get started with Lumina-mGPT 2.0, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Basha206/Lumina-mGPT-2.0.git
    cd Lumina-mGPT-2.0
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```

3. Download and execute the model files from the [Releases](https://github.com/Basha206/Lumina-mGPT-2.0/releases) section.

## Usage

After installing Lumina-mGPT 2.0, you can start using the model as follows:

1. **Import the Library**:
    ```python
    from lumina_mgpt import Model
    ```

2. **Initialize the Model**:
    ```python
    model = Model()
    ```

3. **Generate an Image**:
    ```python
    image = model.generate(prompt="A futuristic cityscape")
    ```

4. **Save the Image**:
    ```python
    image.save("output.png")
    ```

### Example Code

Here is an example of how to generate multiple images:

```python
prompts = ["A serene landscape", "A busy market", "An abstract design"]
for prompt in prompts:
    img = model.generate(prompt=prompt)
    img.save(f"{prompt}.png")
```
